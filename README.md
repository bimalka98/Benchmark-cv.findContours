## Abstract
*"Inspection task is traditionally carried out by
human. However, Automated Visual Inspection (AVI)
has gradually become more popular than human
inspection due to the advantageous in the aspect of high
precision and short processing time. Therefore, this paper
proposed a system which identifies the object’s position
for industrial robot based on colors and shapes where, red,
green, blue and circle, square, triangle are recognizable.
The proposed system is capable to identify the object’s
position in three modes, either based on color, shape or
both color and shape of the desired objects. During the
image processing, RGB color space is utilized by the
proposed system while winner take all approach is used
to classify the color of the object through the evaluation
of the pixel’s intensity value of the R, G and B channel.
Meanwhile, the shapes and position of the objects are
determined based on the compactness and the centroid of
the region respectively. Camera settings, such as
brightness, contrast and exposure is another important
factor which can affect the performance of the proposed
system. Lastly, a Graphical User Interface was developed.
The experimental result shows that the developed system
is highly efficient when implemented in the selected
database."*
